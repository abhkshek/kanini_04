    <h1 style="color: black; font-style: ;">Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
    <P style="font-size: 1.5em; color: red;;">
    Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain.I will list down some of the keys advantages of learning Java Programming:</P>
    <h2 id="p1">Object Oriented</h2>
    <h3 style="color: blue;">
    In Java,everything is an Object.Java can be easily extended since it is based on the object model.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: red; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Platform Independent</h2>
    <h3>Unlike many other programming language include c and c++,when Java is compiled,it is not compiled into platform specific machine,rather into platform Independent byte code.This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine(JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</h3>
    <h2 id="p4"> Simple</h2>
    <h3>
        Java is design to be easy to learn.
    </h3>
    <h2 id="p5">Secure</h2>
    <h3>With Java secure feature it enables to develop virus free.</p>
    <h2 id="p6">Architecture-neutral</h2>
    <h3>Java compiler generates an Architecture-neutral object file format.</h3>
    <h2 id="p7">Portable</h2>
    <h3>
        Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation depends aspects of the specification makes java portable.</h3><b><span style="color: red;">compiler</span>
